    <h1>Virginia Dare</h1>
    <p>We’re on hiatus because we live on opposite coasts.</p>
    <p>The name Virginia Dare has a lot of baggage and history. 
        It's unfortunately been used for a group white supremacists, may they die or come back to reality instead of dragging us back to nazi times! </p><p>
    It was also the name of a popular brand of wine, mentioned in the poem “Harlem Sweeties” by Langston Hughes. Here's an excerpt:</p>

        Glow of the quince
        To blush of the rose. 
        Persimmon bronze
        To cinnamon toes.
        Blackberry cordial,
        Virginia Dare wine—
        All those sweet colors
        Flavor Harlem of mine!</pre></quote>
